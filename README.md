## Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Repository in Transition**: This repository contains both the stable legacy system and an early-stage MCP server implementation.

## Repository Structure

### `/legacy` - Stable Simone System

**To use Simone right now, see [/legacy/README.md](/legacy/README.md) for installation and usage instructions.**

### `/hello-simone` - NPM Installer

The installer package for the legacy Simone system. Install with:

```bash
npx hello-simone
```

### `/mcp-server` - Early Development

üöß **Very early development stage** - The future MCP-based implementation of Simone.

- No documentation yet
- Not ready for use
- Active development in progress
- Will eventually replace the legacy system

## Getting Started

For the current, working version of Simone:

1. Navigate to [/legacy/README.md](/legacy/README.md)
2. Follow the installation instructions there
3. Or simply run `npx hello-simone` in your project
