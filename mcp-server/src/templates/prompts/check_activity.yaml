  # Check Development Activity

  **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!

  **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these 5 items:

  1. Validate time period
  2. Query activity database
  3. Analyze activity patterns
  4. Generate summary report
  5. Present findings and insights

  ## 1 ¬∑ Validate time period

  {{#if period}}
  Using period: "{{period}}"
  {{else}}
  Using default period: "today"
  {{/if}}

  **VERIFY** the period is one of: today, yesterday, 7d, 30d
  
  If invalid, default to "today" and inform the user.

  ## 2 ¬∑ Query activity database

  **READ** the SQLite database at `.simone/simone.db`

  Date range calculations:
  - today: `date('now', 'localtime')`
  - yesterday: `date('now', '-1 day', 'localtime')`
  - 7d: `date('now', '-7 days', 'localtime')`
  - 30d: `date('now', '-30 days', 'localtime')`

  **EXECUTE** query:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM activity_log 
  WHERE date(timestamp) >= date('now', '-X days', 'localtime')
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
  ```

  ## 3 ¬∑ Analyze activity patterns

  **CALCULATE** the following metrics:
  - Total activities count
  - Success vs failure rate
  - Most active tools (top 5)
  - Most common activity types
  - Peak activity hours (if applicable)
  - Tag distribution

  {{#if (or (eq period "7d") (eq period "30d"))}}
  **CREATE** daily breakdown table:
  | Date | Activities | Success Rate | Top Tool |
  |------|------------|--------------|----------|
  {{/if}}

  ## 4 ¬∑ Generate summary report

  **ORGANIZE** findings into these sections:

  ### Overview
  - Period: {{period}}
  - Total activities: [count]
  - Success rate: [percentage]
  - Most active tool: [tool_name]

  ### Activity Breakdown
  Group by activity type and show:
  - Count per type
  - Success rate per type
  - Most recent example

  ### Tag Analysis
  - Most used tags (top 10)
  - Untagged activities percentage

  ### Failed Activities
  {{#if failures}}
  List any failed activities with:
  - Timestamp
  - Tool used
  - Error message
  {{else}}
  No failures found! üéâ
  {{/if}}

  ## 5 ¬∑ Present findings and insights

  **WRITE** a narrative analysis covering:
  - Productivity patterns observed
  - Main focus areas based on activity
  - Notable accomplishments
  - Potential improvements or concerns

  ‚úÖ **Result**: Activity analysis for {{period}} completed

  üîé **Scope**: {{total_activities}} activities analyzed from `.simone/simone.db`

  üí¨ **Summary**: [One paragraph summary of key findings, patterns, and recommendations based on the activity data]

  ‚è≠Ô∏è **Next steps**: 
  - Use `/check_activity 7d` for weekly trends
  - Use `/check_activity 30d` for monthly overview
  - Review failed activities for process improvements
