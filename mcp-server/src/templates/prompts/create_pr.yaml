  # Create Pull Request
  
  **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!
  
  **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these 5 items:
  
  1. Verify branch and changes
  2. Link to issue and gather context
  3. Summarize changes made
  4. Prepare PR description
  5. Create the pull request
  
  ## 1 · Verify branch and changes
  
  Check current branch and changes to ensure:
  - You're on a feature/bugfix branch (not main/master)
  - All changes are committed
  - Branch is pushed to remote
  
  If not pushed yet, push the branch to remote.
  
  ## 2 · Link to issue and gather context
  
  {{#if issue}}
  {{> github}}
  
  Fetch issue #{{issue}} details to understand:
  - Original requirements
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Any design decisions discussed
  {{else}}
  If this PR addresses an issue, identify the issue number from:
  - Branch name (often contains issue number)
  - Recent commit messages
  - Ask the user if unclear
  {{/if}}
  
  ## 3 · Summarize changes made
  
  Review the changes between this branch and {{#if base_branch}}{{base_branch}}{{else}}the default branch{{/if}} to analyze:
  - What files were changed and why
  - Key implementation decisions
  - Any challenges encountered
  - Edge cases handled
  - Tests added or updated
  
  ## 4 · Prepare PR description
  
  Structure the PR description with appropriate sections:
  
  - **Summary**: [Brief overview of what this PR accomplishes]
  {{#if issue}}
  - Include "Closes #{{issue}}" for automatic issue linking
  {{/if}}
  - **Changes**: [List key changes made]
  - **Implementation Notes**: [Important decisions, trade-offs, or explanations]
  - **Testing**: [How changes were tested, edge cases considered, manual testing steps]
  - **Screenshots**: [Include if there are UI changes]
  
  {{> merge_conflict_check}}
  
  ## 5 · Create the pull request
  
  {{> github}}
  
  Create the PR with:
  - Title: "[Type]: Brief description{{#if issue}} (#{{issue}}){{/if}}"
  - Body: [The prepared description from step 4]
  - Base branch: {{#if base_branch}}{{base_branch}}{{else}}default branch{{/if}}
  
  After creating, consider:
  - Adding reviewers if you know who should review
  - Adding labels that match the issue type
  - Linking to any related PRs
  
  Note the PR number that was created for the next steps.
  
  {{#if features.pr_review_wait.enabled}}
  {{> pr_review_wait}}
  {{/if}}
  
  ✅ **Result**: [Describe the actual outcome - PR number created and any relevant details]
  
  🔎 **Scope**: [Describe the PR scope - source branch, target branch, files changed]
  
  💬 **Summary**: [Provide honest summary of what was created, including key changes and any issues encountered]
