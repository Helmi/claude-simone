  # Generate Human-Readable Changelog

  **Version Type**: {{version_type}}
  
  ## Instructions

  1. **First**, run the conventional-changelog command to generate raw entries:
     ```bash
     cd /Users/helmi/code/claude-simone/mcp-server
     pnpm changelog
     ```

  2. **Read** the generated CHANGELOG.md and analyze the new entries under [Unreleased]

  3. **Rewrite** the entries to be more human-readable:
     - Convert technical commit messages to user-friendly descriptions
     - Group related changes together
     - Remove implementation details that don't matter to users
     - Focus on "what changed" and "why it matters"
     - Keep the Keep a Changelog categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security

  4. **Format** following these guidelines:
     - Use clear, concise language
     - Start each entry with a verb
     - Explain the benefit or impact when relevant
     - Avoid jargon and technical implementation details
     - Combine similar small changes into one meaningful entry

  5. **Example transformation**:
     - Technical: "feat(tools): implement SQLite database connection with better-sqlite3"
     - Human: "Added activity logging to track development progress"

  6. **Version bump considerations**:
     - **Patch** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Bug fixes, documentation, small improvements
     - **Minor** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): New features, significant improvements
     - **Major** (0.x.y → 1.0.0): Breaking changes, major milestones

  {{#if (eq version_type "patch")}}
  7. **For patch release**: Focus on bug fixes and small improvements
  {{else if (eq version_type "minor")}}
  7. **For minor release**: Highlight new features and capabilities
  {{else}}
  7. **For major release**: Emphasize breaking changes and migration notes
  {{/if}}

  8. **Finally**, update the [Unreleased] section header with the new version number and today's date

  Remember: The changelog is for humans, not machines. Make it readable and useful!
