  # Capture Project Idea
  
  **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!
  
  **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these 5 items:
  
  1. Engage in idea discussion
  2. Structure the idea content
  3. Determine idea type and priority
  4. Create draft item in GitHub Project
  5. Link related context
  
  ## 1 Â· Engage in idea discussion
  
  Ask the user: "What's your idea? Let's explore it together."
  
  Have a natural conversation to understand:
  - The core concept
  - Why it matters
  - Potential implementation approaches
  - Any concerns or unknowns
  
  {{#if (lt project.riskLevel 5)}}
  Ask clarifying questions until the idea is well-formed:
  - What problem does this solve?
  - How might users benefit?
  - What are the technical considerations?
  - Any dependencies or blockers?
  {{else}}
  Quickly capture the essence and key points
  {{/if}}
  
  Continue the conversation until you have enough context to document the idea properly.
  
  ## 2 Â· Structure the idea content
  
  Based on the discussion, create a structured summary:
  
  **Title**: [Concise, descriptive title]
  
  **Description**:
  - Problem/Opportunity: [What gap or need does this address?]
  - Proposed Solution: [Core concept and approach]
  - Benefits: [Expected value and impact]
  
  **Technical Notes**:
  - Implementation considerations
  - Potential challenges
  - Dependencies or prerequisites
  
  **Open Questions**:
  - [List any unknowns or areas needing research]
  
  ## 3 Â· Determine idea type and priority
  
  Analyze the idea to categorize it:
  
  **Type**:
  - Feature: New functionality
  - Enhancement: Improvement to existing feature
  - Research: Investigation needed
  - Architecture: System design change
  - Other: [Specify]
  
  **Priority Assessment**:
  - Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
  - Effort: [High/Medium/Low]
  - Urgency: [High/Medium/Low]
  
  {{#if (lt project.riskLevel 5)}}
  Confirm categorization with the user
  {{/if}}
  
  ## 4 Â· Create draft item in GitHub Project
  
  {{#if github.github_projects.enabled}}
  {{> github}}
  
  Create a new project item as a draft:
  
  ```bash
  gh project item-add {{github.github_projects.project_id}} \
    --owner {{github.repository}} \
    --title "[TITLE]" \
    --body "[STRUCTURED CONTENT FROM STEP 2]"
  ```
  
  The item will be created at the idea status: `{{github.github_projects.idea_status}}`
  
  Note the created item ID for reference.
  {{else}}
  **GitHub Projects not configured** - Document the idea locally or create a draft issue instead.
  
  Ask the user: "GitHub Projects isn't configured. Would you like to create a draft issue instead?"
  {{/if}}
  
  ## 5 Â· Link related context
  
  Connect the idea to relevant context:
  
  - Search for related issues or PRs
  - Identify relevant code areas
  - Link to documentation or discussions
  
  {{#if github.github_projects.enabled}}
  Update the project item with links to related content if found.
  {{/if}}
  
  Log the captured idea:
  ```
  activity: "Captured project idea"
  tool_name: "create_idea"
  tags: ["idea", "planning"]
  context: "[Brief idea summary]"
  ```
  
  âœ… **Result**: [Describe what was captured - idea title and where it was stored]
  
  ðŸ’¡ **Idea Type**: [State the categorized type and priority assessment]
  
  ðŸ’¬ **Summary**: [Provide summary of the idea discussion and next steps]
