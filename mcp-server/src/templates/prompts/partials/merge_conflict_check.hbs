{{!-- Pre-PR merge conflict detection --}}

## Check for Merge Conflicts

Before creating the PR, ensure your branch can be cleanly merged:

1. Fetch the latest changes from {{#if github.defaultBranch}}{{github.defaultBranch}}{{else}}main{{/if}}
2. Check if your branch would have conflicts when merging into the target branch

If conflicts are detected:
- Consider rebasing your branch on the latest {{#if github.defaultBranch}}{{github.defaultBranch}}{{else}}main{{/if}}
- Resolve any conflicts that arise
- Push the updated branch

Ensure your branch is ready for a clean merge before creating the PR.
