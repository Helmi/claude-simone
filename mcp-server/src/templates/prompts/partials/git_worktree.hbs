{{!-- Git worktree workflow for feature branches --}}

## 4 Â· Setup development branch using git worktree

{{#if features.git_worktree.path}}
Using git worktree with custom path: {{features.git_worktree.path}}
{{else}}
Using git worktree with default path: .worktrees
{{/if}}

Create a git worktree for this issue:

1. Ensure the worktree directory exists at {{#if features.git_worktree.path}}{{features.git_worktree.path}}{{else}}.worktrees{{/if}}

2. Determine branch type based on issue labels:
- If labeled as "bug" or fixing existing functionality: `bugfix/`
- If labeled as "feature" or "enhancement": `feature/`
- Otherwise, analyze issue content to determine appropriate prefix

3. Create a descriptive branch name based on the issue:
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Keep it concise but descriptive
- Example: `feature/add-dark-mode` or `bugfix/fix-login-error`

4. Create the worktree with the new branch at {{#if features.git_worktree.path}}{{features.git_worktree.path}}{{else}}.worktrees{{/if}}/issue-{{issue}}
   branching from {{#if github.defaultBranch}}{{github.defaultBranch}}{{else}}main{{/if}}

5. Navigate to the new worktree directory

6. Verify you're in the correct worktree and on the right branch

**Note**: Work in this isolated worktree to keep your main working directory clean. When the PR is merged, you can remove the worktree at {{#if features.git_worktree.path}}{{features.git_worktree.path}}{{else}}.worktrees{{/if}}/issue-{{issue}}
