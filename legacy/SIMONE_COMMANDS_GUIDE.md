## Best Practices

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Start of day
/simone:prime

# Work on tasks
/simone:do_task
/simone:test
/simone:commit

# End of day
/simone:project_review
```

### Sprint Workflow

```bash
# Sprint planning
/simone:create_sprint_tasks S02

# Sprint execution
/simone:do_task T001_S02_first_task
/simone:do_task T002_S02_second_task
/simone:commit --review

# Sprint review
/simone:project_review
```

### Quick Fixes

```bash
# Bug fix workflow
/simone:create_general_task
# Describe: "Fix memory leak in /src/foo.bar"
/simone:do_task T003
/simone:test
/simone:commit T003
```

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Use YOLO for routine tasks**: Great for implementing straightforward features
2. **Always prime first**: Ensures commands have proper context
3. **Review before major commits**: Catch issues early
4. **Create general tasks for bugs**: Keeps them trackable
5. **Use task-specific commits**: Better traceability

## Command Safety

Simone commands include safety features:

- Won't delete critical files
- Asks before schema changes
- Validates changes against specs
- Maintains code quality standards
- Creates incremental commits
