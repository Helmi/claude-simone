# Specs-Driven Development

Imagine building a house without a blueprint. The foundation might be wrong, the walls might not align, and the final result would be chaotic and unpredictable. In software, writing code without a clear plan can lead to the same problems.

**Specs-Driven Development (SDD)** is the practice of creating that blueprint before any code is written. It is a methodology where a formal, detailed **specification** (or "spec") is the central driver for the entire development lifecycle. This spec acts as the single source of truth for both the human developer and, crucially, the AI partner.

:::note What Problem Does SDD Solve for AI?
Large Language Models are incredibly powerful, but they lack human intuition and deep business context. If you give an AI a vague request, you'll get a vague or incorrect result.

Specs-Driven Development bridges this gap. By providing the AI with a clear, structured, and unambiguous spec, you transform it from an unpredictable generator into a reliable engineering partner. The developer's role evolves from a **coder** to an **architect**â€”designing the blueprint that the AI can then execute with precision.

## The Core Workflow in Simone

In the Simone ecosystem, Specs-Driven Development follows a clear, three-step process that emphasizes planning and precision.

### 1. Define the Spec
The developer's first and most important job is to analyze a problem and create a detailed task specification. This isn't a quick note; it's a formal piece of documentation that leaves no room for ambiguity.

A good spec should include:
- **A Clear Goal:** What is the user story or objective?
- **Acceptance Criteria:** How do we know when the task is done and correct?
- **Constraints & Edge Cases:** What are the boundaries and potential pitfalls?
- **Implementation Notes:** Are there specific patterns, libraries, or functions that must be used?

### 2. AI Implementation
With a clear spec in hand, the developer delegates the implementation to the AI using a simple command, like `/do_task`. Simone loads the spec as the primary context, allowing the AI to focus entirely on translating the well-defined requirements into code.

### 3. Review and Refine
The developer reviews the AI-generated code against the spec. If the output is incorrect or incomplete, the first instinct shouldn't be to fix the code directly. Instead, the developer should ask: **"Is the spec clear enough?"**

By refining the spec and having the AI regenerate the code, the spec remains the true source of truth, ensuring that the documentation and implementation never drift apart.

:::tip The Benefits of a Spec-First Approach
- **Predictable AI:** Dramatically improves the reliability and consistency of the AI's output.
- **Enhanced Developer Focus:** Frees developers from tedious coding to focus on higher-level architecture and problem-solving.
- **Living Documentation:** Your spec library becomes a rich, detailed, and always up-to-date history of your project's functionality.
- **Superior Testability:** Clear acceptance criteria in a spec are the perfect foundation for writing robust unit and integration tests.
